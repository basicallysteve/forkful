# Forkful

Forkful is a small React + TypeScript app for browsing sample recipes and drafting new ones. It runs on Vite for fast development, React Router for navigation, and Sass modules for styling.

## Notes and next steps
- Data is currently in-memory via `src/providers/RecipeProvider.tsx`; extend it to persist to an API
- Add tests (unit or component) as you grow functionality—the repo currently ships without test tooling.
- Add Shopping List and Pantry for managing Ingredients
- Implement AI Features
